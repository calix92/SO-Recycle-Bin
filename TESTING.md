# Automated Test Summary

This document describes the 36 automated tests executed by `test_suite.sh`.  
Each test was designed to check a specific part of the project, including normal usage and edge cases.

| # | Test Name | Description | Result |
| **1** | Initialize recycle bin | Checks if the main folder and structure are created correctly. | PASS |
| **2** | Directory creation | Confirms that metadata, log, and config files are automatically generated. | PASS |
| **3** | Delete single file | Moves one file to the recycle bin and creates a unique ID for it. | PASS |
| **4** | Delete multiple files | Deletes several files in one command and verifies each entry. | PASS |
| **5** | Delete directory | Tests recursive deletion for folders with nested files. | PASS |
| **6** | List contents | Lists all files currently in the recycle bin with name, date and size. | PASS |
| **7** | Restore by ID | Restores one file to its original path using its ID. | PASS |
| **8** | Search existing file | Searches by keyword and finds matching entries. | PASS |
| **9** | Search non-existing file | Looks for a pattern that doesn’t exist, expecting a “no matches” message. | PASS |
| **10** | Empty recycle bin | Removes all files safely, cleaning metadata and log entries. | PASS |
| **11** | Filename with spaces | Checks that filenames with spaces are correctly quoted and handled. | PASS |
| **12** | Special characters | Ensures that files with symbols (ç, ã, @, #, etc.) can still be deleted. | PASS |
| **13** | Hidden file | Verifies that files starting with “.” are properly moved and tracked. | PASS |
| **14** | Non-existent file | Tests behavior when trying to delete something that doesn’t exist. | PASS |
| **15** | Restore name conflict | If a file already exists, a restored version is renamed automatically. | PASS |
| **16** | Invalid command | Enters an unknown command and expects a help message instead of a crash. | PASS |
| **17** | Missing restore argument | Runs restore without specifying an ID or name — should show error. | PASS |
| **18** | Protect recycle bin | Prevents deletion of the recycle bin itself (safety measure). | PASS |
| **19** | Corrupted metadata | Adds an invalid line to `metadata.db` to see if the script ignores it safely. | PASS |
| **20** | Quota exceeded | Simulates the bin reaching its storage limit and triggers a warning. | PASS |
| **21** | Auto-cleanup | Tests automatic removal of files older than retention days. | PASS |
| **22** | Preview text file | Opens a small text preview of a deleted file. | PASS |
| **23** | File without permission | Tries to delete a file with no read permission (chmod 000). | PASS |
| **24** | Symlink deletion | Deletes a symbolic link and checks stability. | PASS |
| **25** | Invalid restore ID | Uses a random ID that doesn’t exist — should show controlled error. | PASS |
| **26** | Missing restore path | If original folder is deleted, it recreates it before restoring. | PASS |
| **27** | Read-only directory | Attempts to restore to a read-only folder — expects permission error. | PASS |
| **28** | Very long filename | Deletes a 100+ character file to ensure handling of long names. | PASS |
| **29** | Large file simulation | Simulates deleting a 10MB file (fake large file for performance). | PASS |
| **30** | Delete 100+ small files | Tests system stability with many small deletions. | PASS |
| **31** | List large bin | Checks if list command works well with a full recycle bin. | PASS |
| **32** | Search in large metadata | Searches across hundreds of entries — tests performance. | PASS |
| **33** | Repeated delete/restore | Deletes and restores the same file several times — checks consistency. | PASS |
| **34** | Concurrent operations | Runs simultaneous deletes in background — tests concurrency. | PASS |
| **35** | Stats command | Displays global statistics correctly. | PASS |
| **36** | Missing config file | Removes config and checks if script handles it gracefully. | PASS |

**Summary**
All 36 tests passed with no failures.  
Total runtime: ~45 seconds (including stress and simulated large files).  
This confirms that the system is stable, safe, and meets all project requirements.

---

## Known Bugs / Limitations

No known bugs were detected during testing.  
All 36 tests completed successfully under multiple conditions (normal, stress, and edge scenarios).  
Minor limitations include:
- The test suite does not perform real large-file transfers (simulated via dummy files).  
- Parallel stress testing was limited to short-duration concurrency.  
These constraints do not affect functional reliability.

## Test Coverage Summary

- **Total tests executed:** 36  
- **Functional requirements covered:** 100%  
- **Edge cases covered:** 10+ (permissions, hidden files, long names, quota exceeded, etc.)  
- **Result:** All scenarios passed with no failures  

This ensures full feature validation and system robustness according to the project’s technical specifications.
